# Software City Demo

## Purpose
This Demo was created to illustrate how an intermediary JSON format can be used to visualize components of software as a so called "Software City". This a demo uses a small set of arbitrary data.
The primary purpose of this project is for me to include this quick demo in a project report.

```
git clone https://github.com/EdwardSpaeth/Praxisphase-Software-City-Demo.git

After that the application should automatically open in your default web browser.
